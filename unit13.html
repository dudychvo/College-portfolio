        <div class="unit_description">
          <p class="about_me_description">
            In this unit, you will investigate the features and uses of websites by exploring what 
            they are and how their integrated components and applications interact with each 
            other.
            You will also learn how to design, develop and test a website for a brief. Once this 
            is completed you will review your website, having obtained feedback from others.

include text, graphics, video or other digital assets.
Typical uses of websites, including: presenting information (e.g. advertising, news), storing information (e.g. archiving, cloud), browsing and searching for information (e.g. real-time information), etc; <b>Features of websites:</b> hyperlinks, action buttons, hot spots, etc;
<b>How can user experience of websites be improved?</b>
Different features of websites can improve the user experience for an individual, 
business or organisation, e.g.: forms that allow customers to leave feedback, dynamic interactions when socialising onlin, applying style sheets to keep the same look and feel for a websit, making websites interactive by embedding digital assets, etc.
