        <div class="unit_description">
          <p class="about_me_description">
            In this unit, you will learn the rules of a programming language and how to write 
            code to develop a successful program. You will be able to apply some of your findings 
            to your own software solutions.
            In addition, you will learn what factors affect the quality of the program and how 
            to produce good quality programs. You will design and develop your own software 
            program to fulfil a brief. You will test your programs for functionality and purpose, 
            and identify and repair faults. You will review your finished program, having obtained 
            feedback from others, and evaluate possible improvements

          <b>Why is software used?</b>
          Software programs instruct a computer’s central processing unit (CPU) to automatically 
          carry out a set of instructions used to solve a problem and/or improve productivity.
          Know why we develop software programs and their uses, e.g.: gaming and entertainment (e.g. computer games, CGI in movies, virtual worlds, 
          social networking), increasing productivity (e.g. automating processes in manufacturing, stock control 
          systems), information storage and management (e.g. stock control systems, booking systems), etc; <b>Characteristics of software programs:</b> programming languages, constructs and techniques.
          <b>Programming languages</b>
          Types of programming language, including procedural languages like Pascal, C and 
          Cobol, and event-driven languages such as VB, VB.NET, VBA, Visual C++.
          Programming languages contain a range of constructs and techniques, including:command words, subroutines, basic string handling, etc; <b>Quality of software programs</b>
          Know that software design and techniques affect the quality of the program developed: efficiency/performance, e.g. the amount of system resources a program consumes 
          (processor time, memory space, accessing storage media), maintainability, e.g. the ease with which a program can be modified by its present or 
          future developers in order to carry out corrective, perfective or adaptive alterations 
          to the code, portability, e.g. the range of computer hardware and operating system platforms on 
          which the source code of a program can be run/compiled/interpreted, etc.

        <p class="about_me_full_description">
          <b>Software development life cycle</b>
Software development life cycle, which includes: assess requirements, design specification, e.g.: scope, inputs, outputs, processing, user interface, constraints (e.g. programming language and timescales for development), etc;
<b>Designing software</b>
Designs include: intended purpose and user requirements (as defined in a brief), a problem definition statement, a proposed solution using design tools, e.g.: a description of the main program tasks – input and output format (such as to add 
two numbers together and display a result), screen layouts and navigation, including prototypes (e.g. initial splash screen or 
main activity screen), algorithms with a description of the method of solution (such as, flowcharts, 
pseudocode and events), data structures, data storage, control structures, data validation, error handling and reporting, a brief outline of alternative solutions for the intended software program 
(e.g. for screen layout and navigation), a list of any pre-defined programs and/or code snippets and their sources , test plan with test data (e.g. testing the inputs and expected outputs and compilation 
of the code), constraints (e.g. device capabilities including connectivity, memory storage or 
programming language), etc.

          <b>Developing software</b>
Develop software: understand a development environment to produce code, develop and refine the software program using suitable programming language 
constructs and techniques, use program constructs and techniques.
<b>Constructs and techniques</b>
Program constructs, e.g.:, comments, constants (variables with a constant value that cannot change), operators (arithmetic [+, –, *, /, %] and logical [<, <=, >, >=, AND, OR, true, 
false]), etc; <b>Testing and refining the software</b>
Test the program solution: for functionality against the test plan with the test data, by reviewing the quality of the program in terms of reliability, usability, 
efficiency/performance, maintainability and portability, gather feedback from others on the quality (reliability, usability, 
efficiency/performance, maintainability, portability) of the solution.
Document any changes to the design, including changes to the source table for 
pre-defined assets. 
Improvements and/or refinements to the software program.

          <b>Reviewing software</b>
          Review the finished software program for: user requirements, fitness for purpose, user experience (e.g. ease of navigation), constraints (e.g. programming language, time, device capabilities (memory, 
          connectivity, quality of the program (e.g. reliability, usability, efficiency/performance, 
          maintainability, portability, strengths and improvements.
