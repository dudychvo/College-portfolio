        <div class="unit_description">
          <p class="about_me_description">
            You will explore the common hardware components of technology systems, such as 
            a touch screen or a printer, and the internal building blocks of a computer like the 
            processor, buses and memory. The unit also covers the purpose of networks, which 
            allow different devices within a technology system to communicate. You will also learn about the role of applications software, such as office programs, 
            graphics packages, accounting software and CAD/CAM, that supports many aspects 
            of everyday business life.

          area network (PAN), mobile broadband), the common uses of network
          systems (resource sharing, data sharing, entertainment,
          communication), etc; <b>Data transfer</b> - Understand the concepts,
          implications and processes of data transfer, including: physical
          methods of transferring data between devices using wireless or cabled
          topology to meet the requirements for a specific user and purpose,
          wireless methods of transfer including the use of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
          technologies,etc;

          computer is represented using binary notation (bit, bytes, word
          length). Understand and use binary format and the concepts of data
          storage, including:, how characters can be represented in binary
          format and convert whole numbers into binary numbers (zero up to 10),
          conversion of binary numbers (up to 8 bits) to whole numbers (base
          10), units used to describe memory and data storage (bit, byte,
          kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte, terabyte, petabyte), etc;
