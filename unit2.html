        <div class="unit_description">
          <p class="about_me_description">
            You will explore the common hardware components of technology systems, such as 
            a touch screen or a printer, and the internal building blocks of a computer like the 
            processor, buses and memory. The unit also covers the purpose of networks, which 
            allow different devices within a technology system to communicate. You will also learn about the role of applications software, such as office programs, 
            graphics packages, accounting software and CAD/CAM, that supports many aspects 
            of everyday business life.
          </p>
          <p class="about_me_description">
            A - understand how the components of technology systems work
            together<br />
            B - understand how data flows between internal components of a
            computer and is processed to provide information<br />
            C - understand different types of software
