          Description of Unit 10: Database Development
        </h2>
        <div class="unit_description">
          <p class="about_me_description">
            In this unit you will investigate the features and uses of databases by exploring what 
they are and what you can do with them. You will be able to apply some of your findings 
to your own database solution.
You will also learn how to use database software to design, develop and test relational 
databases for a brief. Once completed, you will review your database, having obtained 
feedback from others, and evaluate possible improvements.

          <b>Why are databases used?</b>
          The purpose of database software is to store, manage and extract a large amount of 
          organised information for one or more users.
          Know why organisations use databases to: improve productivity, make decisions, present information, etc; 
          Examples of uses of a database: health (data – doctors, patients, appointments), employment (data – name, 
          payroll, department), agencies (data – client, services, reservations), etc; <b>Tools and techniques used in a database</b>
          Tools and techniques include, e.g.: table structures, field characteristics, validation rules, etc; <b>Using databases to improve working practices</b>
          Improving productivity and accuracy in a database, e.g.: creating and presenting financial reports, record keeping, backing up data, etc; <b>Databases and relationships</b>
          Types of databases, e.g.: local, online (web), flat file (contains a single table of information), etc.

          <b>Designing a database</b>
          <b>Designing a database</b>
          Designs should be based around the intended purpose and user requirements as 
          defined in a brief to solve a problem.
          Design documentation, including: hardware, software and other resources required, entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), including entities, attributes and relationships, validation and verification procedures, input and output screens/forms and reports, constraints (e.g. hardware and software availability), test plan with test data to test functionality , a brief outline of alternative design ideas.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">LOC</h2>
        <p class="about_me_full_description"><b>Software tools and techniques to develop a relational database</b>
          Create and edit: single and multiple table structures with appropriate field characteristics, including: field names, field data types, e.g. alphabetic (text and memo), numeric (number, currency, 
          and date/time), alphanumeric (text and memo), logical (yes/no and true/false), 
          web (hyperlink), lookup wizards, field sizes (e.g. byte, integer, long integer, single, double and decimal), field formats (e.g. fixed and decimal places), default values, etc; 
          <b>Testing a database</b>The testing process: test the relational database for functionality, purpose and usability, use feedback from others, for example, on the database’s functionality, its usability, 
          and its performance, consider possible improvements and/or refinements to the relational database, for 
          example, additional tables, additional queries, forms, reports, automation (macros) 
          and security, provide onscreen user navigation and instructions, etc;</p>
        <h2 class="title">LOD</h2>
        <p class="about_me_full_description"><b>Reviewing a database</b>
          Review the finished relational database for: the user requirements and user experience (e.g. usability and reliability), fitness for purpose, any constraints (e.g. hardware and software availability), strengths and improvements.
