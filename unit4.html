        <div class="unit_description">
          <p class="about_me_description">
            Animation is the creation of moving images and has a long history.
            Today modern animations are usually created using a computer. It is
            an exciting and fast moving area of creative technology that
            provides an opportunity to combine creative and technical computing
            skills, and is one in which the UK excels. The creative industries
            have grown considerably in recent years and provide increasing
            employment opportunities. An animator can work in a number of
            different creative areas: creating effects for live-action films,
            feature-length animations and computer games. Non-narrative
            animations feature in online advertising and software interface
            design.

          <p class="about_me_description">
            A - understand the applications and features of digital animation
            products<br />
            B - design a digital animation product
            <br />
            C - create, test and review a digital animation product
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="title">Task 1</h2>
        <p class="about_me_full_description">
          <b>Types of animation</b> - Know the different types of traditional
          and digital based animation, including: flick book, cel animation,
          stop motion, etc; <b>Applications of digital animation</b> -
          Applications and purpose of digital animation, including: different
          existing digitally animated products (e.g. TV programmes, films,
          computer games, music videos, advertisements, internet and mobile
          content, simulation, product development), the effect (e.g. evoke
          emotion, educate) they have on different audiences (e.g. age, gender,
          interest, need), etc; <b>Features of digital animation</b> - Features
          of computer-animated products, e.g.: type of animation, 2-D and 3-D
          models, image type (bitmap/photo and vector), frames per second, etc;
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">Task 2</h2>
        <p class="about_me_full_description">
          <b>What goes into the design?</b> - Designs include: intended audience
          (age, gender, interests), purpose and requirements (as defined in a
          brief), storyboards containing panels which outline the main assets
          (characters, objects, scenes, sounds) and which include some main
          panels that show how the assets combine, with timing, camera angles
          and flow shown, list of any ready-made assets, with their sources
          documented and referenced in a sources table, e.g.: o graphics –
          characters and/or objects o audio clips – speech, sound effects and/or
          music o video clips, alternative ideas for the design, if required,
          prototypes of the animated product, e.g. characters, objects, video
          clips, audio clips, scenes (hand-drawn or computer-generated
          prototypes are acceptable formats for designs), etc.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">Task 3</h2>
        <p class="about_me_full_description">
          <b>Creating the animation</b> - Preparing assets: Gather ready-made
          digital assets (characters, objects, audio clips, video footage) from
          other sources (e.g. internet, media such as CD or DVD), Hand draw or
          use graphic-editing software to create original assets (characters,
          objects and/or backgrounds), Import original and ready-made assets,
          etc; <b>Animation-editing software</b> - 2-D digital animation
          techniques (3-D techniques are acceptable but not required): cut-out
          (either scanned images or digitally generated graphics), rotoscoping,
          skeletal animation, etc; <b>Test the animation</b> Improving the
          animation: test the animated product for functionality (e.g. sound is
          audible, the animation runs, the length of the clip is appropriate),
          test that the animation is fit for purpose, gather feedback from
          others on quality (e.g. the characters and/or objects move as
          intended, timing is accurate, sound quality is high), functionality,
          audience and purpose, etc; <b>Review the animation</b> Review the
          finished digital animation product for: quality of the animation
          product ● fitness for audience and purpose suitability against the
          original requirements
