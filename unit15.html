          <p class="about_me_description">
            In this unit, you will develop an understanding of the benefits and implications of 
installing and maintaining software in technology systems. As specified in a brief, 
you will learn how to install and maintain software in a technology system. This will 
involve installing and upgrading an operating system and different software 
applications, such as office or multimedia programs.
You will also customise different components of software applications to improve 
productivity, for example to create new toolbars and automate a range of tasks 
using a macro. The technology system will be tested for functionality, usability and 
productivity. Once completed, you will review your modified technology system 
against the brief and obtain feedback from the ‘client’, having obtained feedback 
from others, and evaluate possible improvements

          <b>Computer hardware</b>
Hardware to include: internal components of a computer, e.g. network card, memory, processor, external hardware devices, e.g. printer, network router, barcode reader, etc; 
<b>Reasons to maintain technology systems</b>
Know why we maintain technology systems, e.g.: to prevent faults occurring and/or to repair faults, to upgrade internal components, e.g. processor, memory and/or storage, to improve 
performance, etc; <b>Benefits and implications of installing and maintaining hardware</b>
Benefits, e.g.: to reduce costs, to improve performance, e.g. efficiency and effectiveness, to improve/maintain customer service, to improve health and safety awareness.

          <b>Planning for installation and maintenance</b>
Plan to include: purpose of the installation or maintenance, e.g. compatibility, increased capacity, 
increased speed, increased reliability, software requirements, network requirements, requirements of the brief (‘client’/user requirements, alternative ideas for installing and maintaining hardware, i.e. there will be more than 
one way of improving the performance of the technology system, e.g. by increasing 
the memory or upgrading the processo, hardware required, software resources, e.g. printer driver, installation setup and configuration, installation and maintenance activity list, e.g. replace the motherboard battery, 
remove the heat sink and fan to access the processor, back up data and add a printer 
(external device) as part of an upgrade, constraints (costs and technical), e.g. component cost, hardware and software 
availability, tools and component/device compatibility, test plan and, if appropriate, test data (for functionality and performance), etc;

          <b>Install and maintain hardware</b>
Preparation, e.g.: read manufacturer’s hardware instructions, test selection, test configuration, health and safety considerations, including antistatic equipment, precautions, obtain resources (tools, hardware components and devices, access rights, software 
resources), etc; <b>Fault finding</b>
Tools and techniques, e.g.: utility, run-time analysers, test procedures, e.g. follow a test plan, validating information, etc; <b>Installation and maintenance activities</b>
Activities including, e.g.: fit new components and reconnect components and devices, reassemble the computer system, download software resources (hardware drivers), clean , carry out safety checks, etc.
