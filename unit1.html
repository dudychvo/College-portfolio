          Description of Unit 1: The Online World
        </h2>
        <div class="unit_description">
          <p class="about_me_description">
            This unit will help you understand the main technologies and processes behind the 
internet and investigate how they come together to let you view websites and send 
information across the world. The internet and web of tomorrow will be even more 
powerful, more connected, more intuitive and a more important part of our lives. 
This will result in an internet of services, objects and infrastructure (ubiquitous 
computing) which will radically change our lives. For example, smart appliances will 
be able to talk to each other, clothes will monitor our health and retailers will access 
social media to gain insight into shoppers’ preferences.
You will explore a range of digital devices, such as smart phones and digital music 
players and consider the technology that enables these devices to share and 
exchange information.
